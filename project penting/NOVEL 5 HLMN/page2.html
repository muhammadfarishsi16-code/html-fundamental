    <p>The Pact’s strength grew swiftly, uniting their armies beneath banners gilded in gold and blood.</p>
    <p>Dravengard’s dragons burned cities that resisted; Serpenthara’s spies ensured none dared rebel.</p>
    <p>Volmir ruled the conquered lands with iron order, while Noxvalen’s mages cloaked the empire in illusion.</p>
    <p>From the laboratories of Pandemon came weapons that defied the laws of nature itself.</p>
    <p>Aureath’s sky legions descended like angels of war, casting judgment from the clouds.</p>
    <p>Each kingdom’s strength became a single blade forged in darkness — and wielded by The Shadowfang Pact.</p>
    <p>They built monuments of black stone and golden flame, marking the world as theirs.</p>
    <p>Those who opposed them vanished into the silence of shadowed prisons.</p>
    <p>Fear became the new faith; obedience, the new salvation.</p>
    <p>And the world bowed to a unity born of terror.</p>
