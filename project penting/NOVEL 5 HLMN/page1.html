    <p>In an age when kingdoms bled and empires crumbled, six sovereign powers sought salvation through unity.</p>
    <p>From the ashes of conquest and betrayal, they forged an alliance unlike any before — The Shadowfang Pact.</p>
    <p>It began with whispers among rulers weary of endless wars, their emissaries meeting in the ruins of an ancient citadel.</p>
    <p>The dragon banners of Dravengard fluttered beside the serpent sigils of Serpenthara, symbols of might and cunning intertwined.</p>
    <p>Volmir’s lion roared defiance, while Noxvalen’s star guided the pact beneath shadowed heavens.</p>
    <p>Pandemon brought forbidden science, merging death with progress, and Aureath’s golden eagles watched from above.</p>
    <p>Thus was born a secret dominion, its oath sealed not by faith — but by fear.</p>
    <p>The Shadowfang Pact vowed to reshape the world beneath a single crown of shadow and flame.</p>
    <p>But unity in darkness breeds its own monsters...</p>
    <p>Their first decree: erase the memory of those who opposed them.</p>
